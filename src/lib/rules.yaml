    SC1: 
        main: "All Scoring statuses are evaluated after the Match ends. Scores are calculated once all Triballs, Field Elements, and Robots on the field come to rest."
    SC2:
        main: "Scoring of the Autonomous Bonus is evaluated immediately after the Autonomous Period ends (i.e., once all Triballs, Field Elements, and Robots on the field come to rest). "
        a: "Elevation Tier points are not included in the calculation of an Alliance's score for the purposes of determining the Autonomous Bonus."
        b: "If the Autonomous Period ends in a tie, including a zero-to-zero tie, each Alliance will receive an Autonomous Bonus of four (4) points."
    SC3: 
        main: "A Triball is considered Scored in a Goal if it meets the following criteria: "
        a: "The Triball is not contacting a Robot of the same color Alliance as the Goal."
        b: "At least two (2) corners of the Triball are within the Goal (i.e., are under the Net and have \"broken the plane\" of the outer edge of the PVC pipes that define the Goal volume)."
    SC4:
        main: "A Triball is considered Scored in an Offensive Zone if it meets the following criteria: "
        a: "The Triball is not contacting a Robot of the same color Alliance as the Offensive Zone."
        b: "The Triball is contacting the gray foam tiles within the Offensive Zone"
        note: "Offensive Zone scoring is based on contact with the gray foam tiles in each Offensive Zone. In the case of any close calls, referees may use a \"paper test\" (i.e. gently slide a piece of paper under the Triball) to determine which Offensive Zone it should be scored in. If the Triball is contacting both Offensive Zones, then it is not considered Scored in either Zone. See Figure 23."
    SC5:
        main: "Alliance Triballs may be Scored in any Goal or Offensive Zone, and always count toward the same color Alliance as the Triball. For example, a red Alliance Triball that meets the definition of Scored in the blue Goal will count as 5 points for the red Alliance. "
        a: "To be eligible for points, Alliance Triballs must not be contacting any Robots of the same color Alliance as the Triball."
        b: "Rule <SC3a> does not apply to Alliance Triballs"
    SC6:
        main: "Elevation points are comparative, and are awarded based on the Elevation Tiers achieved by all Robots at the end of the Match. The highest-Elevated Robot will receive the highest number of Elevation points, followed by the second-highest, and so on. If multiple Robots are measured at the same Elevation Tier, they will receive the same amount of points."
    SC7:
        main: "An Autonomous Win Point is awarded to any Alliance that has completed the following tasks at the end of the Autonomous Period:"
        a: "Removed the Triball from the Alliance's Match Load Zone that coincides with their Starting Tiles. For example, in Figure 18, the red Alliance must remove the Triball that begins in the bottom-left Match Load Zone, adjacent to Robot 1â€™s Starting Tiles."
        b: "Scored at least one Alliance Triball in the Alliance's own Goal."
        c: "Ended the Autonomous Period with at least one Robot contacting their own Elevation Bar."
        d: "Not violated any other rules."
